# JavaScript Koans: A Journey of Discovery üßò

Welcome, apprentice, to the JavaScript Koans! This project is designed to help you learn and solidify your understanding of fundamental JavaScript concepts through a series of interactive challenges.

Inspired by traditional Zen Koans, these exercises require you to contemplate and fix "broken" assertions within the code. By replacing the `__` placeholders with the correct values, you will mend the code and, in doing so, illuminate your understanding of JavaScript.

## The Path Ahead ‚ú®

This collection guides you through several key areas of JavaScript:

1.  **JavaScript Basics (`js_koan_basics.js`):** Master the foundational elements like `if/else` statements, `while` and `for` loops, and function declarations (including arrow functions).
2.  **The Blueprint - Classes (`js_koan_classes.js`):** Delve into Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript. Understand constructors, methods, inheritance (`extends`, `super`), static methods, and private fields (`#`).
3.  **Asynchronous Wisdom (`js_koan_async.js`):** Explore the non-blocking nature of JavaScript. Learn about Promises, `async/await`, `setTimeout`, `Promise.all`, and making network requests using `Workspace` (or similar).
4.  **Handling Requests (`js_koan_express.js`):** Understand server-side logic with Express.js. Learn about handling different HTTP verbs (POST, PUT, DELETE, GET) and returning appropriate HTTP status codes.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** You'll need Node.js installed to run these JavaScript files. Version 18+ is recommended for native `Workspace` support and modern JavaScript features. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm:** Node.js comes bundled with npm (Node Package Manager), which is used to install project dependencies.
- **Terminal/Command Line:** Basic familiarity with using your terminal for commands like `cp` and `node`.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

1.  **Clone or Download:** Get the project files onto your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url> # Don't download the ZIP
    cd <project-directory>
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Open your terminal in the project directory and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This will install `chalk` (for colorful console output), `express`, and `cors` (used by the Koans and the simple server).

## How to Embark on Your Journey üöÄ

1.  **Copy the Koan File:** Before you start editing, make a copy of the Koan file you want to work on. This keeps the original file intact if you need to start over. In your terminal, use the `cp` command (or manually copy/paste the file using your file explorer):

    - For the Basics Koan: `cp js_koan_basics.js basics-koan.js`
    - For the Classes Koan: `cp js_koan_classes.js classes-koan.js`
    - For the Async Koan: `cp js_koan_async.js async-koan.js`
    - For the Express Koan: `cp js_koan_express.js express-koan.js`

2.  **Open Your Working Copy:** Open the _copied_ file (e.g., `basics-koan.js`, `express-koan.js`) in your code editor.

3.  **Find the Blanks:** Locate the lines containing `mustAssert(...)` in your _copied_ file. Your task is to replace the `__` placeholder within the assertion's _condition_ (e.g., `mustAssert(result === __, ...)` becomes `mustAssert(result === 'expected value', ...)`). **Do not** modify the original `js_koan_*.js` files.

4.  **Run Your Working Copy:** Execute the _copied_ file using Node.js from your terminal:

    ```bash
    node basics-koan.js
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    node classes-koan.js
    ```

    or (for the async koan - **ensure server.js is running first! See note below.**)

    ```bash
    node async-koan.js
    ```

    or (for the express koan - **runs its own server internally**)

    ```bash
    node express-koan.js
    ```

5.  **Observe the Output:**

    - If you see green messages (decoded from Base64!), your assertion is correct. The path unfolds!
    - If you see a red `üõë Assertion Failed:` message, you need to rethink your answer for that specific blank in your copied file.

6.  **Repeat:** Continue filling in the blanks in your copied file and running it until all assertions pass for that Koan. Then, copy the next original Koan file (e.g., `cp js_koan_classes.js classes-koan.js`) and repeat the process.

**Special Notes:**

- **Async Koan (`async-koan.js`):**

  - This Koan includes a section that interacts with a separate, simple web server (`server.js`).
  - **Before** running `node async-koan.js`, you need to start this server. Open a _separate_ terminal window, navigate to the project directory, and run:
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
  - Keep this server running while you work through `async-koan.js`. You should see a message like `üîÆ Async Koan server listening at http://localhost:1337`.

- **Express Koan (`express-koan.js`):**
  - This Koan involves creating and interacting with a simple Express.js server _within the same file_.
  - Unlike the Async Koan, you do **not** need to start a separate server process. Running `node express-koan.js` will handle both the server setup and the test requests automatically.

## Bonus Challenge üèÜ

The original `js_koan_basics.js` file includes a bonus challenge: Create your own `Greeter` subclass that shouts the greeting in uppercase. Add and test your creation within your `basics-koan.js` file!
